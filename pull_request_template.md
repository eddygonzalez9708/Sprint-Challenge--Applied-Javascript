# Self-Study Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager

- [ ] What is the DOM?

- [ ] What is an event?

- [ ] What is an event listener?

- [ ] Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

- [ ] What is a component?

# Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

- [ ] Look through the HTML code paying particular attention to the Tabs component and the Cards components. You will notice they share a data attribute. We will be using this data attribute to determine which cards should show when each tab is selected.

- [ ] Following the instructions in the Tabs.js file, complete the TabLink, and TabCard class components. It will look and feel very similar to the last project we worked on, but with a twist. Now, instead of one Item to display, we will need to display a collection of Cards. Think about ways to iterate over an array and manipulate each item. Note: You will need to un-comment the code after the lines of instructions. The code is commented out so you can work error-free

- [ ] Once you get your Tab component working properly add a couple more articles yourself and check out how it works.
